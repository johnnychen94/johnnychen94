### Hi there üëã

I'm from China, and my name is Jiuning Chen (Èôà‰πÖÂÆÅ). You can also call me Johnny as it pronounces
the same as "Jiuning" in Chinese. As you can guess from my account name, I was born in 1994; not
too young, and not too old.

I was a philosophy student, and now I'm a PhD student in mathematics. I enjoy sharing knowledges
with others, yet I'm a slow learner, or at least I think so.

I use MATLAB, Python, Julia, Ansible, Docker for my daily work. Among those I enjoy Julia most. I
heard people code ~100 lines in average per day, in that sense, I'm a poor programmer.

I do image processing and deep learning for my daily research. I do not want to be one of the too
many in the overly optimistic _typical_ deep learning fields; that's not very fun. Or in other
words, I do not want to throw myself into a field that everyone is interested in; I don't think
that's how innovation comes up. Nevertheless, I'm a poor scientist speaking of (the number of)
publications so I can hardly justify what I just said.

A few noteworthy things I did since I became a programmer:

- I created and maintained the lab infrastructure for my supervisor in [Math@ECNU]
- I set up the first few Julia mirrors in China with [StorageMirrorServers.jl]
- I lead the JuliaCN community together with [Jun Tian], [Roger Luo] and others
- I maintain the JuliaImages ecosystem together with [Tim Holy] and [Zygmunt L. Szpak]
- I'm an active JuliaImages mentor during [GSoC (Google Summer of Code)][GSoC] and [OSPP (Open
  Source Promotion Plan)][OSPP] events

I said I enjoy sharing my knowledges with others, here are a few tutorials I made (in Chinese):

- Julia ÂÖ•Èó®Á≥ªÂàó‰πã‰∏ÄËµ∑ËØªÊñáÊ°£ (Learn Julia by reading the docs together with me) in [Bilibili][‰∏ÄËµ∑ËØªÊñáÊ°£]
- Julia ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂèäÂÖ∂Â∫îÁî® (a series of lecture that introduces Julia in ECNU) with its materials [here][Julia ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂèäÂÖ∂Â∫îÁî®]
- Julia ‰ª£Á†Å‰∏≠ÁöÑÂÖ∏ÂûãËÆæËÆ°Ê®°Âºè in JuliaCN 2021 meetup in [bilibili][Julia ‰ª£Á†Å‰∏≠ÁöÑÂÖ∏ÂûãËÆæËÆ°Ê®°Âºè]
- (ÊÄªÊúâ‰∏ÄÂ§©‰ºöÂÜôÂÆåÁöÑ) [Julia Êï∞Â≠óÂõæÂÉèÂ§ÑÁêÜÂÖ•Èó®][Image-Processing-in-Julia]

There are a few other personal projects for research and fun, listed in stars-count order:

- [jill.py]: a cross-platform julia installer written in Python
- [DemoCards.jl]: manage Julia demo gallery automatically
- [Sixel.jl]: display image in terminal
- [JpegTurbo.jl]: JPEG support via libjpeg-turbo
- [ecnu_net_login]: Âçé‰∏úÂ∏àËåÉÂ§ßÂ≠¶ Ê†°Âõ≠ÁΩëÁΩëÂÖ≥‰∏ÄÈîÆÁôªÂΩï (login ECNU network in terminal, the simple way)
- [PkgServerClient.jl]: sets julia package mirror smartly
- [colab-julia-bootstrap]: template used to set up Julia in Google colab
- [WNNMDenoise.jl]: WNNM (Weighted nuclear norm minimization) for image denoise
- [LocalBinaryPatterns.jl]: local binary patterns as a family of low-level image features

I use macOS most of the time because I think it's the best interface for programmers even though it
is not as customizable as Linux or as powerful as Windows.

I dislike competition, I enjoy collaboration. I'm bad at advertising. I enjoying fixing things by
breaking it up.

I just paused my Ph.D career and am working fulltime in [tongyuan.cc](https://github.com/Suzhou-Tongyuan)
for the next year (or next two years) to try to bring Julia in China to the next level. It's a full-time
job (career) that I plan to devote most of my time to, thus so I'm afraid that I don't have much time
contributing freely to personal projects.
